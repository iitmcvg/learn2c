 1. How computers see, pixel access, color spaces, images(as a matrix)..								(1 hr)
 2. Operations on images - thresholding, blurring, opening, closing 									(1 hr)
 3. Extracting data from an image - not only colors(histogram), v hv features -- edges, corners. 
 																--  something about non-max suppression	(1 hr)
 4. Discussion -- about some problems..																	(1/2 hr)
 5. Features -- shapes --> after contours
 	Not only features, generalised -- contours
 	Features - coordinate transforms(parameterisation), then shapes -- lines, circle..					(1 hr)
 6. Hands on session -- on PS 																			(2 hrs)
 7. Template Matching , (maybe gaussian pyramids and hybrid images) 									(1 hr)
 8. Harris corner detection 
 9. Discussion -- about sessions till now															    (1/2 hr same day)
 10. Scale invariant features -- maybe SIFT																(2 hrs)
 11. Machine learning gen intro 																		(2 hrs)
 	 Fitting and Alignment -- least square fit method ,RANSAC (for SVM) 
 12. Project Ideation session and allocation.															(1 hr)
